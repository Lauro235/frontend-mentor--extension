## General Challenge

I wanted to take a card design that I had completed for Frontend Mentor and apply it to React. I wanted to use it as an opportunity to learn about pagination and scroll techniques.

## Challenges faced

Using refs with TypeScript was a frustrating experience. I'm still struggling with creating the appropriate React generics, and understanding how the generics interact with different types of hooks (like useRef) and functions.

## Request for Code Improvement Suggestions

I would love to hear from you if you think there are any performance optimisations that can be made or if the code could be organised better in places.

Thanks so much for reading and supporting,
Lorentz
